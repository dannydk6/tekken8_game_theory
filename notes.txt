when there are trades in dmg to both opponents, you take the difference between both damage values
limitations:
- recoverable damage is erroneously considered equal to full damage
- how were calculating grab damage
- frame advantage not considered outside of direct punishes
- unoptimal float combo damage
- in rage art scenarios, we do not include the healing in the calculation
- assumes human is breaking no-mix throws 100%


notes:
- you can compute dominated payoffs by multiplying the dominated option's payoff with the nash equilibrium's 
distribution for the optimal defender's moves
SUM of dominated payoff per option times the nash equilibrium distribution for that option
- added nash equilbrium to BT4 on block (which was computed separately)

exclusions
- 1,2f (-13 into lib)
- f 3+4 (backturn to lib)
- BT sidestep (0 payoff except against hopkick and loses to mash)
- b 1+2 (mostly zero)
- b (leaves BT)
- db(evasive leave out of bt)
- rage art
